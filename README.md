# Analyzing Temperature Data

## INTRODUCTION
This project aims to analyze a data set that represents global and local temperature. The main tool is Excel where we studied 
the behavior of the moving average. We started first by analyzing local temperature data. Then, we investigated the global temperature data. Lastly, we compared the two curves on the same figure and documented several similarities and differences.
